## Overview
*flashfm-ivis* provides a suite of interactive visualisation plots to view potential causal genetic variants that underlie associations that are shared or distinct between multiple quantitative traits and compares results between single- and multi-trait fine-mapping. Unique features include network diagrams that show joint effects between variants for each trait and regional association plots that integrate fine-mapping results, all with user-controlled zoom features for an interactive exploration of potential causal variants across traits.

## Availability and Implementation
*flashfm-ivis* is an open-source software under the MIT license. It is available as an interactive web-based tool [http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/flashfm-ivis/](http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/flashfm-ivis/) and as an R package. Code and documentation are available at [https://github.com/fz-cambridge/flashfm-ivis](https://github.com/fz-cambridge/flashfm-ivis). Additional features can be downloaded as standalone R libraries to encourage reuse.
