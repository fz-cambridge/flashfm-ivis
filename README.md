## Overview
*flashfm-ivis* provides a suite of interactive visualisation plots to view potential causal genetic variants that underlie associations that are shared or distinct between multiple quantitative traits and compares results between single- and multi-trait fine-mapping. Unique features include network diagrams that show joint effects between variants for each trait and regional association plots that integrate fine-mapping results, all with user-controlled zoom features for an interactive exploration of potential causal variants across traits.

## Availability and Implementation
*flashfm-ivis* is an open-source software under the MIT license. It is available as an interactive web-based tool [http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/flashfm-ivis/](http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/flashfm-ivis/) and as an R package. Code and documentation are available at [https://github.com/fz-cambridge](https://github.com/fz-cambridge) and [https://github.com/jennasimit](https://github.com/jennasimit). Additional features can be downloaded as standalone R libraries to encourage reuse. 

## Installation
Users can directly use the online version of these tools without installing any packages or previous experience in programming languages. If users would like to run analyses in their local machines, then please download the codes from this GitHub repo and open the Rshiny app in the local [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).
