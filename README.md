## Overview
*flashfm-ivis* provides a suite of interactive visualisation plots to view potential causal genetic variants that underlie associations that are shared or distinct between multiple quantitative traits and compares results between single- and multi-trait fine-mapping. Unique features include network diagrams that show joint effects between variants for each trait and regional association plots that integrate fine-mapping results, all with user-controlled zoom features for an interactive exploration of potential causal variants across traits.
